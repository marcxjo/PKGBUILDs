MarÄ‰jo's PKGBUILDs
===================

The scripts in this repo come in three flavors:

* Not fit for the AUR (e.g., metapackages)
* Not ready for the AUR (note: scripts are removed from this repo once uploaded
  to the AUR, with a commit log advising of as much)
* Already in the AUR (presented here with my own varyingly pedantic or petty
  tweaks)

I push scripts to this repo once I get a successful build out of them, but I
prefer to experiment with them and verify my work before attempting to push them
to the official repo. As such, use the scripts here provided at your own risk.
Conversely, pull requests with fixes for build issues are welcome and encouraged.
